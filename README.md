# Martyna Kuciara - to-do list

## Demo
https://marthiness.github.io/to-do-list/

## Description
I made this application to practise what I've learned in online course.

## How to use application
In this application you can make your to-do list by writting your tasks in "Co jest do zrobienia?" and then click "Dodaj zadanie" or just press Enter.
You may mark tasks that you have already done by clicking green icon or delete them by clicking red icon.

If you want to mark all tasks done, click "Ukończ wszystkie". You can also hide all done tasks by pressing "Ukryj ukończone". If you need to bring back done tasks, click "Pokaż ukończone".
